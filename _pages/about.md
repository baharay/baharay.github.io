I recently got my PhD from the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Sabine Süsstrunk and Dr. Mathieu Salzmann.

My main research interest lies in computer vision, particularly in deep saliency prediction, which involves understanding and predicting the regions of an image that capture human attention. My work aims to improve these models particularly by incorporating temporal information and dissimilarity thus enhancing the accuracy and application of saliency prediction algorithms.

To achieve this, I leverage techniques from machine learning, neuroscience, image processing, and data analysis, aiming to both understand and design better mechanisms for human visual attention in artificial systems.
